# Udacity Mobile Flashcards

## About the project

This is the 4th project for Udacity's React Nanodegree Program.

It is based on the flashcard study method. When opened, it will default to a list of decks available to study, if there are no current decks it will populate the list with dummy data.

You can add new decks, and fill them with study cards. You can also add cards to existing decks. Each deck allows to stud the cards on it by completing a quiz on the deck's material.

The project was bootstrapped  using [expo](https://expo.io/).
It was tested on iOS using the xCode iPhone emulator for , as well as  on Android using a Samsung Galaxy M31 using the Expo App.

To run the Procet, just run `yarn` to install all needed dependencies and then `yarn start` to start it.
If running on an Android device download the Expo app onto the device.
